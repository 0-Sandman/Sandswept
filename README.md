| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FzvQCmNZ/image1.png" width="64"/> | **Primary:** Direct Current | Fire an arcing electric current for 250% damage. Hitting enemies generates 1 Charge. | Has no damage falloff, a blast radius of 2.5m and a proc coefficient of 1.0. Hitting multiple enemies with one projectiles gives Charge for each enemy hit. |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwM8hGL6/image2.png" width="64"/> | **Secondary:** Release | Lose all Charge. Fire a piercing blast for 400% damage, increasing up to 1600% at full Charge. | Has no damage falloff, a bullet radius of 2m and a proc coefficient of 1.0. Gains 120% base damage per Charge linearly.

| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gjmfqDHt/image4png.png" width="64"/> | **Special:** Overdrive | Agile. Transform your rifle, replacing all of your skills with scorching forms. Charge amplifies base damage gain while in full heat. | Restocks 50% of your secondary charges (rounded down), and 50% of your utility charges (rounded up), can be used to quickly combo. |
| | | | |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SNb1P012/tex-Overdrive-Fire.png" width="64"/> | **Primary:** Enflame | Agile. Fire a rapid stream of bullets for 90% damage. Heat increases ignite chance and spread. | Fires 6 shots per second, has standard damage falloff a proc coefficient of 0.8. Spread increases by 2.5% per 1% of heat linearly. |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/m2DBKrYy/tex-Exhaust.png" width="64"/> | **Secondary:** Exhaust | Ignite. Fire a short-range heat burst for 8x180% damage. Increase heat by 15%. | Has buckshot damage falloff, and a proc coefficient of 0.5. Has medium spread, and small self knockback. |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vB6XPXWt/tex-Heat-Signature.png" width="64"/> | **Utility:** Heat Signature | Agile. Stunning. Sidestep a very short distance and deal 250% damage. Hitting enemies generates 3 Charge. | Has 0.2s of i-frames and a proc coefficient of 1.0. |

Release a fire nova around you that deals 300% base damage, increasing up to 900% in full heat. Consume all heat, gaining an attack speed boost, and exit overdrive. | Has a radius of 16m, and a proc coefficient of 1.0. Increases attack speed by 50% for up to 5s, duration increases per 1% of heat exponentially (0.05 * ((heat / 1.51991108) ^ 1.1). Restocks 50% of your secondary charges (rounded down), and 50% of your utility charges (rounded up), can be used to quickly combo. |
| <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/52w9KFnf/heat-Mechanic.png" width="64"/> | **Heat Mechanic** | While in overdrive, you passively build up heat and healing reduction. While in full heat, increase base damage by a lot, which is further amplified by Charge, but take increasingly high self-damage. | While in Overdrive, you passively build up 12% heat per second, and gain a 10% healing reduction debuff per 10% of heat. Additionally, after being in full heat for at least one second your base damage increases by 30% per second, which is amplified by 10% linearly for every Charge (so, up to 60% base damage per second at 10 Charge), however you take 1.3% of your maximum health as self-damage 5 times a second, which bypasses armor and block, and increases by 40% for every second spent in full heat. Base damage gain and self-damage reset once you exit Overdrive. Healing reduction lingers for 2s afterwards. |
