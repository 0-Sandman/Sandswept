      - This is just an unfinished update we had before we knew of Alloyed Collective's release date, not much was done just yet and there will be later additions.
      - Some content "overlap" with AC will be kept in because it's distinct enough, like Pocket Plutonium and Osmium elites. Parry equipment might get a rework.
      - Ranger's Galvanize, Char and Heat Sink will get reworks as well, and hopefully her model (and then new animations) can be finished in a few months time..
